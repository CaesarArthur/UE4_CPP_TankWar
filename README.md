# Tank War
## Powered with Unreal Engine 4 and C++

### The Project
This game is a gameplay test based of the uDemy course of [Ben Tristem](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/). Obviously I'll add my Unreal experience all along the project to power up the game.
I don't know where i'm going myself BUT, if you are unterested in the project you are free to re-use the code or even play with it.

### My Goals
* Finally learn Cpp with Unreal Engine
* Create a fun little game in less that a couple of weeks
* put my past experience of Unreal in the project to create a game really beyond what I could expect
* use my Physics / Maths hobby to ehance the game experience (bullet physics, ...)
